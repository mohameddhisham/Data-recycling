# Data-recycling

As an RTM and Data analyst, I frequently encountered challenges with manual data filtering using Excel, especially when dealing with large datasets. To address these limitations, I developed a Python-based solution that automates the filtering process, saving me countless hours and improving my productivity⏳.

My project utilizes the pandas library to efficiently filter data, remove unwanted records, and handle large files. This approach not only speeds up my workflow but also ensures greater accuracy and consistency in my results✔⏩ .
